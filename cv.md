##My Goals:
1. Improve web development skills;
2. Successfully complete the course JavaScript/Front-end;
3. Get my first job offer as a web developer;
4. Improve my knowledge and skills every day;

##Skills:
I started studying JS, HTML and CSS recently. To do this, I used courses such as:
*CS50
![CS50](images/cs50_min.png)



*Dmitry Lavrik courses

*The Complete JavaScript + React Course - From Zero to Result

I also used literature:

*"Java Script для чайников"
*"Грокаем алгоритмы"

And of course i can't learn JS without practice. Services like this help me:

*Codewars
*FreeCodeCamp

For example code from Codewars:
```
function makeUpperCase(str) {
  return str.toUpperCase()
}
```


I am currently actively using **VSCode**. It is a very handy editor for me. There are many good extentions for faster and more productive work.

For example my mini-project in GitHub:
[Movies](https://github.com/VladislavaKosyrikhina/Movies)


My level of english A2. I would like to know English better, so perhaps I will add one more item to the "goals".
